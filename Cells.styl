/* VIEW - Controls individual elements of a list or table.
 *
 *  The ".view" selector generally belongs to lists or tables of data. It specifically controls the individual elements that
 *  are present within those lists (e.g. a single cell within a table). Common examples associated with this selector
 *  include:
 *
 *      - The file chooser side bar in GEdit
 *      - The various lists found throughout Unity Tweak Tool
 *      - Files within Nautilus (only when viewing items as a list)
